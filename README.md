This repository contains the assignments for the Academic Course â€œSpecial Antennas-Antenna Synthesis" taught in the Spring of 2018-2019 in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Electrical & Computer Engineering.

 

## Project A

The goal of the Project was the analysis and optimization of three antennas with different parameters. For the simulations 4nec2 software was used after the construction of the geometry of the antennas using MATLAB.  

The antennas which were analysed are: 

* Discone Antenna 

* Spiral Antenna 
*  Television Antenna with 4 sets of crossed dipoles and a reflector

The behavior of each antenna was studied and explained through simulations (such as Input impedance of the antenna, 2D or 3D radiation patterns, Reflection Coefficient and VSWR) that were considered for different wavelengths and frequency bands .

<u>Comments</u>

The geometry of the 2nd antenna was created  exclusively through 4nec2 software. 



##  Project B

The 2nd project is related to **BeamForming** and **Direction of Arrival** (**DoA**) algorithms and aims at the understanding of such techniques. More specifically, **NSB** beamformer with Diagonal Loading was analysed for varying SNR and minimum angle difference for incoming signals. The project also analyzes the performance of block-data weight adaptation achieved, using the **Sample Matrix Inversion (SMI)** algorithm. Finally, the limit angle difference for two signals in order to be seperately identified for the **CAPON** DoA algorithm, is considered.
